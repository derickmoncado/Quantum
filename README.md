# Quantum â€” A Boilerplate for Front End Developers
Quantum is a Bootstrapped, Gulp-powered, Sassified, front end boilerplate that's focused on automated web development. It comes with Browsersync, hot reloading, Slick carousel, and much more. Quantum is also all built on top of Handlebars.js for easy HTML templating ðŸ”¥

### Baked-in Features:

* Bootstrap 4
* Gulp 4
* Sass
* Bourbon
* Handlebars.js
* Emergence.js
* Slick Carousel
* Browsersync + hot reloading
* Animate.css
* Compilation
* Autoprefixing
* Sourcemaps
* Concatenation
* Minification
* Linting
* Accessibility reports


### Details

Quantum is a lightweight starter kit focused on automated frontend web development and has the following primary features:

-	Handlebars HTML templates with Panini. Panini is a super simple flat file generator for use with Gulp. It compiles a series of HTML pages using a common layout. These pages can also include HTML partials (rejoice), external Handlebars helpers, or external data as JSON.
-	Sass compilation and prefixing with Autoprefixer using Sass 7-1 architecture pattern, and JavaScript concatenation + minification
-	Built-in BrowserSync server - this will automatically reload your page when files are changed. It also live-injects CSS changes when you save a Sass file. This task runs continuously and defaults to localhost.
-	CSS compression, JavaScript compression, Image compression and more.


### How to use

ðŸš¨ Changes should be committed to `src/` files only! ðŸš¨

Primary Gulp tasks to run are:
-	`gulp dev` for general development
-	`gulp prod` for production builds (compiles, minifies, concatenates everything into a folder called `/dist` etc.)

There is also:
-	`gulp linters` to run all linting tasks for HTML, SCSS, and JS
-	`gulp accessibility` to run accessibility tasks that creates an accessibility report .txt file in a folder called `reports`


### Requirements

To use Quantum, you'll need:

-	Node.js | Test: run ` node -v ` in the terminal
-	npm | (Node comes with npm installed). Test: run ` npm -v`  in the terminal
-	Gulp | `npm install -g gulp`


### Installing:

- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/dmoncado/quantum`
- Navigate into the repo directory: `cd quantum`
- Install all node packages: `npm install` or `sudo npm install`
- Run `gulp dev`
- Your site is now viewable at: http://localhost:3000
- Build something great! (start from the HTML partials and style with the SCSS partials, just go nuts.)

NOTE:
- Once a project is nearing completion and you want to create compressed, concatenated, production-ready files, run `gulp prod`. This will delete everything in the `dist` folder and recreate it instantly with all of your working files compiled. Never make updates directly into the dist folder as these files get overridden each time. Also, The dist folder is not kept in source control - check the .gitignore file to remove it if you'd like.


### Folder Structure:

- `dist/` - compiled files (minified and concatenated only with `gulp prod`)
- `node_modules` - front-end dependencies (.gitignore'd)
- `src/` - contains all of your core, working filesâ€”static assets, pages, templates, etc
- `src/assets/` - scss files, JS files, images, and fonts
- `src/layouts/` - HTML layouts templates
- `src/pages/` - site pages
- `src/partials/` - handlebars partials files (HTML Partials)
- `gulpfile.js` - all task definitions
- `package.json` - handles the front-end dependencies
- `.htmllintrc` - handles the HTML lint rules
- `.sass-lint.yml` - handles the SCSS lint rules
- `reports` - txt generated file for accessibility issues (when you run the gulp task for it)

Happy Coding ðŸ¤“
